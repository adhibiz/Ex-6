# Ex-6-Combined-Scenarios

## Aim
To explore the complete UX design process by ideating solutions, writing user stories and scenarios, developing user flows, and designing information architecture using a known UX problem.

## UX Problem Chosen
**Booking an appointment in a hospital app**

---

## 1. Solution Ideation

**Method Used**: Crazy 8s

### Low-Fidelity Idea Concepts:
1. **One-tap appointment**: A home screen button that books a repeat appointment in 1 tap.
2. **Voice-based booking**: Use voice commands to book appointments.
3. **Chatbot flow**: Conversational booking system using a smart chatbot.
4. **Doctor availability view**: Calendar-style interface to view and book doctor slots.
5. **Urgent care quick book**: Emergency option that bypasses regular booking flow.
6. **Family booking feature**: Manage appointments for multiple family members.
7. **Integrated health record view**: See recent reports before booking.
8. **Smart reminders**: Personalized reminders for follow-ups or tests.

## 2. Creating User Stories

### Persona Used: **Deepa Menon (45, School Teacher with diabetes)**

#### User Stories:
1. As a **working mother**, I want to **book doctor appointments quickly**, so that **I don’t miss work hours**.
2. As a **diabetic patient**, I want to **set follow-up reminders**, so that **I never forget checkups**.
3. As a **non-tech-savvy user**, I want to **use a simple interface**, so that **I can book easily without help**.
4. As a **parent**, I want to **book appointments for my children**, so that **I can manage all health visits in one place**.
5. As a **returning patient**, I want to **view past appointment history**, so that **I can keep track of my treatments**.

## 3. Creating Scenarios

### Selected User Story:
*As a diabetic patient, I want to set follow-up reminders so that I never forget checkups.*

### Scenario:
Deepa, a 45-year-old school teacher, finishes a long day at school and remembers she needs to book her 3-month diabetes follow-up. She opens the hospital app while cooking dinner in her kitchen. She’s tired and distracted, so she appreciates the simple home screen. With a few taps, she books an appointment with her regular physician and sets a reminder. She feels relieved and more in control of her health routine.

- **Emotional State**: Tired, slightly anxious
- **Environment**: Home kitchen, evening
- **Tasks**: Open app → Book appointment → Set reminder
